## Why Rizm?

Rizm is a self-hosted workspace built to keep planning and execution in one continuous flow. Teams can manage work in boards, tables, and a collaborative wiki, while the AI Assistant helps with chat-based administration, user management, and actions that use the data already stored in the workspace.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project management** | Board and table views for structured work |
| **Wiki** | Collaborative editing with real-time sync |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol server for AI integration |
| **AI Assistant & Administrator** | Chat-based system administration, user management, and context-aware actions using stored workspace data |

## Quick Start

Requires Docker and Docker Compose (`docker compose`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta.git
cd rizm-beta
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\scripts\setup-win.cmd local
```

**Linux:**
```bash
bash ./scripts/setup-linux.sh local
```

**macOS:**
```bash
bash ./scripts/setup-macos.sh local
```

Access Rizm at `http://localhost:8080` and sign in with the default first-run credentials: `admin@example.local` / `change-this-password`. The hosted [demo](https://demo.test-perspective.com/) signs you in as admin automatically — the login screen is skipped.

For domain deployment, manual setup, MCP configuration, and other operational details, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta/wiki): [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta/wiki/Deployment%E2%80%90Guide), [Deployment Guide.ja](https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta/wiki/Deployment%E2%80%90Guide.ja), [MCP Setup](https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta/wiki/MCP%E2%80%90Setup), [Licensing and Future Updates](https://github.com/test-perspective/rizm-beta/wiki/Licensing%E2%80%90and%E2%80%90Future%E2%80%90Updates).
